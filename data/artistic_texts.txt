I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;

Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.

A dream within a dream.
Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow —

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand —

The Raven: Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary...

Ode to a Nightingale: My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains...
